**US Retail Sales Forecasting**

This project applies time series forecasting techniques to predict US monthly retail sales using the SARIMA model. The objective is to analyze trends, seasonality, and future patterns in sales data sourced from the US Census Bureau.

**Project Objectives**

Load and clean historical US retail sales data.

Perform time series decomposition and visualization.

Build and evaluate a SARIMA model for forecasting future retail sales.

Measure forecast performance using RMSE.

**Technologies Used**

Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels (SARIMA), scikit-learn (for evaluation).

**Dataset**

Source: US Census Bureau

Data Type: Monthly sales figures (seasonally adjusted)

**Model**

SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA): Selected after analyzing data stationarity, seasonality, and autocorrelation.

Forecasts were generated and compared with test data to evaluate model accuracy.

**Results**

Trend and seasonal patterns identified.

Forecasts aligned closely with historical trends.

Model performance evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
